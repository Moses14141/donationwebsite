                    <img src="images/PXL_camp_lushagala.jpg" alt="Goma Displacement Camps" class="section-image left">
                    <p>In the shadow of relentless conflict and displacement, Goma, a city perched on the edge of
                        eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), faces an unrelenting humanitarian crisis. As the M23
                        rebel group intensifies its advance in early 2025, violence has uprooted hundreds of thousands,
                        swelling the population of overcrowded camps around the city. With over 700,000 displaced
                        individuals already in North Kivu’s capital before this escalation, and thousands more fleeing
                        daily, Wokovu Way NGO emerges as a critical shield for Goma’s most vulnerable—families, women,
                        and youth left exposed to harsh weather and dire conditions. Dedicated solely to providing
                        tents, Wokovu Way battles brutal elements and overwhelming demand to offer a fragile refuge in a
                        region torn by war.</p>
                    <p>This mission is rooted in Goma, where the organization works tirelessly to distribute tents to
                        camps like Lushagala and Bulengo, transforming flimsy barriers into symbols of hope. Amid the
                        chaos of conflict, these shelters protect against rain, wind, and despair, standing as a
                        testament to resilience in the face of adversity. <a href="html_links/wokovuway_story.html" class="read-more">Learn

                    <img src="images/PXLtents_distr.jpg" alt="Tent Distribution in Goma" class="section-image right">
                    <p>Wokovu Way NGO has made it its mission to shield displaced families by delivering tents to the
                        sprawling camps encircling Goma. With the displaced population surpassing 800,000 by March 2025
                        due to the M23 offensive, the demand for shelter has reached a crisis point. These
                        tents—constructed from durable tarpaulin and reinforced poles—serve as more than mere
                        structures; they are lifelines, offering a fragile but essential barrier against the region’s
                        punishing weather and a semblance of dignity for families torn from their homes. Wokovu Way
                        prioritizes the most vulnerable, including single mothers like Amina, who arrived at Lushagala
                        camp with her four children after their village was razed.</p>
                    <p>In sites like Lushagala, where over 71,000 people huddle in makeshift shelters, Wokovu Way has
                        distributed more than 5,000 tents since January 2025. These shelters protect against the
                        relentless rain and wind sweeping from Lake Kivu, preventing camps from becoming disease-ridden
                        quagmires. For Amina, the tent provided by Wokovu Way became a sanctuary, allowing her children
                        to sleep dry for the first time in weeks. <a href="success.html" class="read-more">Read Amina’s

                    <h3>HARSH WEATHER</h3>
                    <img src="images/roof_edited.jpg" alt="Rain in Goma Camps" class="section-image left">
                    <p>Goma’s climate poses a formidable challenge to those without proper shelter, especially during
                        the rainy season peaking in March 2025. Nestled near Lake Kivu and the Albertine Rift, the city
                        endures heavy rainfall and fierce winds that transform displacement camps into muddy, flooded
                        wastelands. For the over 800,000 displaced individuals, these conditions are brutal—torrential
                        downpours soak belongings, turn dirt floors into swamps, and heighten the risk of waterborne
                        diseases like cholera, which spiked in camps last year.</p>
                    <p>The volcanic terrain, scarred by Mount Nyiragongo’s eruptions, offers little stable ground, with
                        rocky soil causing tent stakes to loosen and structures to collapse under pressure. High
                        humidity and frigid nights further compound the hardship, leaving families vulnerable to
                        pneumonia and other illnesses. Wokovu Way’s teams work around the clock to reinforce tents with
                        additional tarps and sandbags, but the wear and tear from these elements demand constant
                        repairs. <a href="success.html" class="read-more">Discover how we adapt to these conditions.</a>

                <div class="article-section">
                    <h3>OVERCROWDING AND DEMAND</h3>
                    <img src="images/Camp_lushagala.JPG" alt="Overcrowded Goma Camps" class="section-image right">
                    <p>The crisis in Goma is exacerbated by severe overcrowding, a challenge that stretches Wokovu Way’s
                        resources to the breaking point. Camps like Bulengo and Kanyaruchinya are bursting, with new
                        arrivals fleeing M23’s advance—hundreds of thousands displaced in just weeks, according to the
                        International Organization for Migration’s January 2025 report—piling into spaces already packed
                        beyond capacity. This influx has overwhelmed the supply of tents, leaving Wokovu Way struggling
                        to shield a population growing faster than aid can reach.</p>
                    <p>Supply chains are a bottleneck—roads into Goma, vital for delivering tents and materials, are
                        frequently blocked by fighting or rendered impassable by mud and debris from heavy rains. The
                        closure of Goma’s airport and restrictions on lake transport, noted in early 2025 updates,
                        further hinder logistics. Distribution in these chaotic, overcrowded camps is a Herculean task,
                        with families competing for the few available tents. Many, like elderly widow Fatuma, wait days
                        in the rain, only to find stocks depleted, exposing them to the elements. <a href="donate.html"

                <div class="article-section">
                    <h3>PARTNERSHIP EFFORTS</h3>
                    <img src="images/together.jpg" alt="Wokovuway with Partners" class="section-image left">
                    <p>Wokovu Way does not face this crisis alone, relying on strategic collaboration with local and
                        international partners to amplify its impact. Local organizations like AGIR-DRC, deeply embedded
                        in Goma’s camps, assist with tent distribution and coordination, leveraging their knowledge to
                        identify the most desperate families. International partners, including the UN’s humanitarian
                        agencies, provide logistical support when possible, helping source tents and navigate fractured
                        supply routes despite ongoing conflict.</p>
                    <p>These partnerships have enabled Wokovu Way to distribute over 7,000 tents across North Kivu since
                        the crisis escalated, a feat that would be impossible alone. However, funding shortages—only 43%
                        of UNHCR’s $233 million plan for DRC was met by late 2023, a trend likely worsened in
                        2025—strain these alliances. Wokovu Way’s grassroots agility keeps it effective, but looted
                        infrastructure and limited resources mean many tents arrive damaged or insufficient. The
                        organization improvises with repairs, but the scale of need outpaces even this resilience. <a

                <div class="article-section">
                    <h3>ONGOING STRUGGLE</h3>
                    <img src="images/PXL_camp_LGL.jpg" alt="Hope Amid Crisis in Goma" class="section-image right">
                    <p>Wokovu Way’s relentless efforts in Goma embody a fierce commitment to shielding communities amid
                        a spiraling crisis. By providing tents, they offer protection from the worst of the
                        weather—rain-soaked nights, biting winds, and flooded camps—giving displaced families like
                        Amina’s a fragile foothold. Yet, the challenges are immense: harsh environmental conditions
                        erode tents quickly, overcrowding stretches supplies thin, and logistical nightmares hinder
                        delivery. The M23 advance in March 2025, coupled with recent floods that submerged parts of
                        Bulengo camp, adds urgency to an already desperate situation.</p>
                    <p>Collaboration with partners provides a lifeline, but with funding lagging and infrastructure
                        crumbling, the fight is far from won. Wokovu Way aims to distribute 10,000 more tents by
                        mid-2025, a goal that hinges on increased support. For now, each tent raised is a victory, a
                        shield against the elements and a beacon of hope. In Goma, where mercy is scarce, Wokovu Way’s
                        work is a race against time to protect the vulnerable. <a href="volunteer.html"
