                <div class="article-section">
                    <h3>TRANSFORMING HEALTH CARE IN GOMA</h3>
                    <img src="../images/health_care_intro.jpg" alt="Wokovuway Health Care" class="section-image left">
                    <p>In Goma, a city grappling with conflict, displacement, and recurring epidemics, access to health care remains a critical challenge. With over 800,000 displaced individuals living in camps as of March 2025, diseases like cholera, malaria, and Ebola threaten lives daily. Wokovuway, a grassroots NGO, is committed to transforming health care in this volatile region by addressing immediate medical needs, supporting epidemic responses, and laying the groundwork for better sanitation to prevent diseases. Through strategic partnerships with organizations like Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) and the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), Wokovuway delivers life-saving health interventions to the most vulnerable.</p>
                    <p>Our approach combines direct health care delivery with preventive measures, ensuring that displaced families not only survive but thrive. From mobile health clinics to maternal health support, Wokovuway is making a tangible difference in Goma’s camps, where the lack of clean water and sanitation fuels disease outbreaks. Our efforts align with global health goals, such as reducing cholera deaths by 90% by 2030, as supported by initiatives like the Global Task Force on Cholera Control. <a href="about.html" class="read-more">Learn more about our mission.</a></p>

                <!-- Section 2: Mobile Health Clinics -->
                <div class="article-section">
                    <h3>MOBILE HEALTH CLINICS</h3>
                    <img src="../images/mobile_clinic.jpg" alt="Mobile Health Clinic in Goma" class="section-image right">
                    <p>In partnership with Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), Wokovuway has established mobile health clinics in displacement camps like Lushagala, where overcrowding and poor sanitation make disease outbreaks a constant threat. In 2024, these clinics treated over 10,000 individuals for diseases such as cholera, malaria, and acute respiratory infections, which spike during the rainy season. These mobile units bring essential medical care directly to families who lack access to hospitals, offering vaccinations, treatments, and health education to prevent the spread of infections.</p>
                    <p>By providing immediate care in camps, Wokovuway reduces the burden on Goma’s overwhelmed health facilities and helps curb the spread of epidemics. For example, during the 2024 mpox outbreak in eastern DRC, our mobile clinics supported early detection and isolation efforts, protecting vulnerable populations. This initiative not only saves lives but also builds trust within communities, encouraging them to seek medical care when needed. <a href="success.html" class="read-more">Read more about our health impact.</a></p>

                <!-- Section 3: Maternal Health Support -->
                <div class="article-section">
                    <h3>SUPPORTING MATERNAL HEALTH</h3>
                    <img src="../images/maternal_health.jpg" alt="Maternal Health Support" class="section-image left">
                    <p>Wokovuway collaborates with the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) to support maternal health and combat gender-based violence (GBV) in Goma’s displacement camps. In early 2025, we distributed dignity kits—containing hygiene products, clothing, and sanitary items—to 5,000 women in Kanyaruchinya camp. These kits address menstrual hygiene needs, reducing the risk of infections and allowing women to maintain dignity during displacement. Additionally, our partnership with UNFPA supports maternal health by providing access to prenatal care and safe delivery services in camps.</p>
                    <p>Women in conflict zones like Goma are particularly vulnerable to health complications during pregnancy. By ensuring access to hygiene resources and medical care, Wokovuway helps reduce maternal mortality and supports healthy pregnancies. Our GBV prevention programs, in collaboration with MenEngage Alliance, also create safer environments for women, addressing a root cause of health disparities. <a href="https://www.unfpa.org" class="read-more">Explore UNFPA’s work.</a></p>

                <!-- Section 4: Epidemic Response -->
                <div class="article-section">
                    <h3>RESPONDING TO EPIDEMICS</h3>
                    <img src="../images/epidemic_response.jpg" alt="Epidemic Response in Goma" class="section-image right">
                    <p>Goma has faced numerous epidemics, including 15 Ebola outbreaks over the past 40 years and a recent upsurge of mpox in 2024. Wokovuway plays a vital role in epidemic response by supporting health partners during crises. During the 2024 rainy season floods in Bulengo camp, where 15,000 people were displaced, Wokovuway worked with the US Embassy’s humanitarian aid office in Kinshasa to distribute 2,000 weather-resistant tents. This intervention prevented a spike in waterborne diseases like cholera by providing dry shelter to families.</p>
                    <p>Our mobile health clinics, in partnership with MSF, also play a key role in epidemic surveillance and response. By offering testing and treatment in camps, we help contain outbreaks like mpox and Ebola before they spread. Wokovuway’s collaboration with health partners ensures that Goma’s displaced communities receive timely interventions, reducing the risk of widespread disease outbreaks. <a href="donate.html" class="read-more">Support our epidemic response efforts.</a></p>

                <!-- Section 5: Sanitation and Disease Prevention -->
                <div class="article-section">
                    <h3>SANITATION AND DISEASE PREVENTION</h3>
                    <img src="../images/sanitation.jpg" alt="Sanitation Efforts in Goma" class="section-image left">
                    <p>Inadequate sanitation in Goma’s displacement camps is a major driver of disease outbreaks, with over 1.7 billion people globally lacking basic sanitation facilities. Wokovuway’s tent distribution efforts indirectly address this issue by providing dry, safe shelter, which reduces exposure to contaminated water during floods. For instance, our 2024 response in Bulengo camp protected 15,000 individuals from waterborne diseases like cholera, which claims thousands of lives annually in DRC.</p>
                    <p>Looking ahead, Wokovuway aims to partner with the International Rescue Committee (IRC) to improve water and sanitation infrastructure in camps. By 2026, we plan to install water pumps and sanitation facilities in five major camps, serving 50,000 people. These efforts will provide clean water for drinking and handwashing, significantly reducing the risk of diseases like diarrhea, which kills 395,000 children under five globally each year. <a href="volunteer.html" class="read-more">Join our sanitation initiatives.</a></p>

                <div class="article-section">
                    <h3>BUILDING A HEALTHIER FUTURE</h3>
                    <img src="../images/future_health.jpg" alt="Future Health Goals in Goma" class="section-image right">
                    <p>Wokovuway is committed to building a healthier future for Goma’s displaced communities. We aim to expand our mobile health clinics to reach 20,000 people annually by 2026, focusing on vaccinations and epidemic preparedness. In partnership with UNFPA, we plan to establish permanent women’s health centers in five camps, providing maternal care and GBV support to 20,000 women each year. These centers will also offer hygiene education to prevent infections.</p>
                    <p>Additionally, our collaboration with MenEngage Alliance will scale up GBV prevention programs, targeting 10,000 men and boys by the end of 2025 to foster safer communities. By integrating health care, sanitation, and education, Wokovuway is creating a holistic approach to disease prevention, ensuring that Goma’s most vulnerable can live with dignity and hope. <a href="donate.html" class="read-more">Help us build a healthier Goma.</a></p>
