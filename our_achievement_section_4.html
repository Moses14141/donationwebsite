                <div class="article-section">
                    <h3>CHALLENGING GENDER NORMS IN GOMA</h3>
                    <img src="../images/goma_gender_norms.jpg" alt="Community Gathering in Goma" class="section-image left">
                    <p>In Goma, North Kivu, where conflict and displacement have displaced over 1 million people into camps as of March 2025, rigid gender norms often perpetuate inequality, limiting women’s opportunities and reinforcing patriarchal structures. Wokovuway, a grassroots NGO, is working to challenge these norms by promoting positive masculinity traits among men and boys, fostering an environment where gender equality can thrive. Through strategic partnerships with organizations like MenEngage Alliance, Wokovuway engages men as allies in empowering women, addressing the root causes of gender-based violence (GBV) and systemic inequities.</p>
                    <p>Positive masculinity encourages traits like empathy, respect, and leadership that support rather than suppress women’s rights. In a region marked by violence, including clashes with groups like M23, and cultural attitudes that often marginalize women, Wokovuway’s initiatives are a beacon of hope. By involving men and boys in the journey toward gender justice, we aim to create lasting change that benefits entire communities, aligning with global efforts to achieve gender equality by 2030, as outlined in the Sustainable Development Goals. <a href="about.html" class="read-more">Learn more about our mission.</a></p>

                <div class="article-section">
                    <h3>MASCULINITY AND POSITIVITY: EMPOWERING WOMEN</h3>
                    <img src="../images/masculinity_positivity.jpg" alt="Men and Boys in Community Dialogue in Goma" class="section-image right">
                    <p>In a society where rigid gender norms often marginalize women, Wokovuway takes a transformative approach by engaging men and boys in promoting gender equality in Goma. In collaboration with MenEngage Alliance, we encourage positive masculinity traits such as confidence and leadership to break harmful gender stereotypes. In 2024, Wokovuway trained 500 men and boys in displacement camps like Lushagala, raising awareness on GBV prevention and menstrual hygiene management (MHM), fostering a deeper understanding of the challenges women face.</p>
                    <p>These initiatives go beyond awareness; they encourage men to become active allies in women’s empowerment. During a recent community dialogue in Lushagala in 2025, men were encouraged to support women in decision-making roles, building their confidence to challenge traditional expectations. By promoting qualities like empathy and accountability, Wokovuway helps men redefine masculinity in a way that supports equality, creating an environment where women and girls can thrive. This approach helps reduce violence and fosters healthier, more respectful relationships within Goma’s communities. <a href="donate.html" class="read-more">Support our work for gender equality.</a></p>

                <!-- Section 3: Community Dialogues for Change -->
                <div class="article-section">
                    <h3>COMMUNITY DIALOGUES FOR CHANGE</h3>
                    <img src="../images/community_dialogue.jpg" alt="Community Dialogue in Goma" class="section-image left">
                    <p>Wokovuway’s community dialogues are a cornerstone of our efforts to promote positive masculinity and gender equality in Goma. These dialogues bring together men, women, and community leaders to discuss gender norms, challenge stereotypes, and build mutual understanding. In 2025, we organized a series of dialogues in Lushagala and Bulengo camps, reaching over 1,200 participants. Men were encouraged to take on caregiving roles and support women’s leadership, breaking the cultural expectation that men should dominate decision-making.</p>
                    <p>These discussions also address the intersection of masculinity and GBV, encouraging men to reject violence and embrace nonviolent conflict resolution. Participants have reported a shift in attitudes, with many men expressing a newfound respect for women’s contributions to the community. By creating safe spaces for open conversation, Wokovuway fosters a culture of accountability and respect, laying the groundwork for more equitable relationships in Goma’s displacement camps and beyond. <a href="success.html" class="read-more">Read stories of transformation.</a></p>

                <!-- Section 4: Economic Empowerment Impacts -->
                <div class="article-section">
                    <h3>ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT THROUGH SHARED ROLES</h3>
                    <img src="../images/economic_empowerment.jpg" alt="Men and Women Working Together in Goma" class="section-image right">
                    <p>Promoting positive masculinity has a direct impact on women’s economic empowerment in Goma. By encouraging men to share domestic responsibilities, such as caregiving and household tasks, Wokovuway enables women to participate more fully in economic activities. In 2024, our programs in Kanyaruchinya camp supported 300 women in starting small businesses, like tailoring and market vending, after their husbands took on more household duties following our masculinity workshops.</p>
                    <p>This shift reduces the burden on women, who globally spend three times more hours on unpaid care work than men, according to UN Women. By involving men as allies, Wokovuway helps women access economic opportunities, contributing to household income and community resilience. For instance, women in our tailoring program, like Esther from previous success stories, report increased earnings and independence, supported by husbands who now value shared roles. This economic empowerment strengthens families and challenges the notion that men must be the sole breadwinners. <a href="volunteer.html" class="read-more">Join our empowerment initiatives.</a></p>

                <!-- Section 5: Shifting Cultural Norms -->
                <div class="article-section">
                    <h3>SHIFTING CULTURAL NORMS FOR EQUALITY</h3>
                    <img src="../images/cultural_shift.jpg" alt="Cultural Shift in Goma" class="section-image left">
                    <p>In Goma, cultural norms often dictate that men hold power over women, perpetuating inequality and GBV. Wokovuway’s work with men and boys is gradually shifting these norms by promoting a vision of masculinity rooted in respect and partnership. Through our partnership with MenEngage Alliance, we’ve engaged 700 men in 2024 across Goma’s camps in workshops that challenge patriarchal attitudes, encouraging them to see women as equals in both the home and community.</p>
                    <p>These efforts align with global movements to transform masculinities, as seen in MenEngage Africa’s campaigns during the 16 Days of Activism, where men marched alongside women to advocate for GBV prevention. In Goma, our programs have led to measurable change: a 14% reduction in attitudes accepting violence among participants, mirroring results from the World Bank’s DRC GBV project. By redefining what it means to be a man in Goma, Wokovuway is creating a cultural shift that supports women’s rights and fosters a more equitable society. <a href="https://menengage.org" class="read-more">Explore MenEngage’s work.</a></p>

                <!-- Section 6: Future Goals -->
                <div class="article-section">
                    <h3>BUILDING A FUTURE OF GENDER JUSTICE</h3>
                    <img src="../images/future_equality.jpg" alt="Future of Gender Equality in Goma" class="section-image right">
                    <p>Wokovuway is committed to scaling up our efforts to promote positive masculinity and gender equality in Goma. By 2026, we aim to train 10,000 men and boys across five major displacement camps, focusing on GBV prevention, shared caregiving, and women’s leadership support. We also plan to expand our community dialogues to reach 5,000 more participants, fostering broader cultural change across North Kivu.</p>
                    <p>Our vision is a Goma where men and women work as equals to build resilient communities, free from the constraints of harmful gender norms. By continuing to partner with organizations like MenEngage Alliance and UNFPA, and by integrating these efforts with our existing programs—like women’s tailoring and MHM education—Wokovuway is paving the way for a future where gender justice is a reality for all. In a city shaped by conflict, these initiatives offer hope for a more equitable and peaceful tomorrow. <a href="donate.html" class="read-more">Help us build a future of equality.</a></p>
