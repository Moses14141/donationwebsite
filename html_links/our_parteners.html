                    <h3>OUR PARTNERSHIPS</h3>
                    <img src="/images/PXL_partener_visit.jpg" alt="Wokovuway Partnership" class="section-image left">
                    <p>In the heart of eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Goma stands as a city under siege—not
                        only by the relentless conflict with groups like the M23 rebels but also by the sheer scale of
                        displacement and humanitarian need that defines its existence. As of March 2025, over 800,000
                        displaced individuals cram into camps around the city, facing harsh weather, disease, and
                        insecurity. In this dire context, Wokovuway, a grassroots NGO dedicated to shielding vulnerable
                        communities, recognizes a fundamental truth: no single organization can tackle such a crisis
                        alone. Our mission to provide tents, health support, and advocacy for the displaced is magnified
                        through strategic partnerships with a wide array of humanitarian organizations, both local and
                        international.</p>
                    <p>These collaborations are the backbone of our operations, enabling us to pool resources, share
                        expertise, and extend our reach to those who need it most—single mothers, orphaned children, and
                        youth uprooted by violence. From distributing tents in sprawling camps like Lushagala to
                        advocating for women’s rights on global platforms, our partnerships are built on mutual respect,
                        shared goals, and a deep commitment to empowering Goma’s people. By working hand-in-hand with
                        local groups, UN agencies, and global NGOs, we ensure that our efforts are not only effective
                        but also sustainable, offering displaced families a chance to rebuild their lives with dignity.

                    <h3>LOCAL ALLIANCES</h3>
                    <img src="/images/Discuss_need.jpg" alt="Local Partners in Goma"
                        class="section-image right">
                    <p>Wokovuway’s deep roots in Goma give us a unique advantage: an intimate understanding of the
                        city’s cultural, social, and logistical landscape. This foundation is strengthened through our
                        partnerships with local organizations that share our vision for a resilient Goma. Groups like
                        AGIR-DRC, a community-based organization operating across North Kivu, have been instrumental in
                        our efforts to distribute tents and other essentials to displacement camps such as Lushagala,
                        Bulengo, and Kanyaruchinya, where over 200,000 displaced individuals reside. AGIR-DRC’s
                        on-the-ground knowledge helps us identify the most vulnerable families—those often overlooked in
                        the chaos of crisis—ensuring that our aid reaches those in dire need.</p>
                    <p>Another key local partner, the Goma Women’s Collective, collaborates with Wokovuway to address
                        the specific needs of women and girls in camps. Together, we’ve established safe spaces in
                        Bulengo camp, providing not only shelter but also psychosocial support for survivors of
                        gender-based violence (GBV), a pervasive issue in eastern DRC. In 2024 alone, our joint efforts
                        reached over 3,000 women, offering them a sanctuary from the insecurity that pervades their
                        daily lives. These local alliances allow us to navigate the region’s challenges—flooded roads,
                        ongoing skirmishes, and cultural nuances—delivering aid with precision and care. <a

                <div class="article-section">
                    <h3>INTERNATIONAL COLLABORATIONS</h3>
                    <img src="/images/international_colaboration.jpg" alt="International Partners"
                        class="section-image left">
                    <p>While local partnerships anchor our work, our collaborations with international organizations
                        provide the scale and resources necessary to tackle Goma’s massive humanitarian crisis.
                        Wokovuway has forged strong ties with global players like Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), which
                        has been a lifeline in delivering health support to displaced communities. In 2024, MSF
                        supported Wokovuway in setting up mobile health clinics in Lushagala camp, treating over 10,000
                        individuals for diseases like cholera and malaria, which spike during the rainy season. This
                        partnership has been crucial in complementing our tent distribution efforts, ensuring that
                        families not only have shelter but also access to medical care to survive the harsh conditions.
                    </p>
                    <p>We also work closely with the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), particularly on initiatives
                        to combat GBV and support maternal health. In early 2025, UNFPA provided funding and supplies
                        for Wokovuway to distribute dignity kits—containing hygiene products, clothing, and sanitary
                        items—to 5,000 women in Kanyaruchinya camp. These kits, distributed alongside our tents, offer
                        women a sense of normalcy and protection in an environment where basic needs are often unmet.
                        Additionally, our collaboration with MenEngage Alliance has helped us engage men and boys in GBV
                        prevention programs, fostering community-wide change. These international partnerships amplify
                        our reach, bringing global expertise and resources to Goma’s doorstep. <a

                <!-- Section 4: A Case Study -->
                <div class="article-section">
                    <h3>CASE STUDY</h3>
                    <img src="/images/analysis.jpg" alt="Partnership Case Study" class="section-image right">
                    <p>One of the most impactful examples of our partnerships in action occurred during the 2024 rainy
                        season, when torrential floods submerged parts of Bulengo camp, displacing over 15,000
                        individuals within days. Wokovuway, in collaboration with the US Embassy’s humanitarian aid
                        office in Kinshasa, launched an emergency response to provide tents and emergency supplies to
                        the affected families. The US Embassy’s support enabled us to secure 2,000 high-quality,
                        weather-resistant tents, which were distributed within a week, shielding families from the
                        relentless rain and preventing a spike in waterborne diseases.</p>
                    <p>Local partner AGIR-DRC played a pivotal role in this operation, coordinating with community
                        leaders to ensure equitable distribution. One beneficiary, Esther, a mother of five, shared her
                        relief: “The rain had taken everything—our clothes, our food. But the tent from Wokovuway gave
                        us a dry place to sleep. It felt like a miracle.” This operation not only saved lives but also
                        strengthened our partnership network, proving the power of collaboration in crisis. By combining
                        the US Embassy’s resources with AGIR-DRC’s local expertise and Wokovuway’s distribution network,
                        we turned a potential disaster into a story of resilience. <a href="../html_links/esther_story.html"

                <!-- Section 5: Challenges in Collaboration -->
                <div class="article-section">
                    <h3>CHALLENGES IN COLLABORATION</h3>
                    <img src="/images/PXL_partnership.jpg" alt="Challenges in Goma" class="section-image left">
                    <p>While our partnerships have been transformative, they are not without challenges. The
                        humanitarian crisis in Goma is staggering, with over 800,000 displaced individuals as of March
                        2025, and resources are perpetually stretched thin. Funding shortages are a persistent issue—by
                        late 2023, only 43% of UNHCR’s $233 million plan for DRC was met, a trend that has likely
                        worsened in 2025, leaving partners like Wokovuway, MSF, and UNFPA with limited supplies to
                        distribute. This scarcity forces difficult decisions, such as prioritizing certain camps over
                        others, often leaving families in remote areas like Kanyaruchinya without support.</p>
                    <p>Logistical hurdles further complicate collaboration. Roads into Goma are frequently blocked by
                        fighting or rendered impassable by mud during the rainy season, delaying deliveries of tents,
                        medical supplies, and other aid. In early 2025, the closure of Goma’s airport and restrictions
                        on lake transport due to insecurity severed key supply routes, leaving our partners struggling
                        to deliver promised resources. Additionally, coordinating with multiple organizations—each with
                        its own priorities and protocols—can lead to delays and miscommunication. Despite these
                        obstacles, Wokovuway remains committed to fostering strong partnerships, adapting to challenges
                        with resilience and creativity. <a href="../donate.html" class="read-more">Help us overcome
                            these challenges.</a></p>

                    <img src="/images/power.jpg" alt="Future of Partnerships in Goma"
                        class="section-image right">
                    <p>Looking to the future, Wokovuway aims to deepen and expand our partnerships to meet the growing
                        needs of Goma’s displaced communities. One key goal is to strengthen our collaboration with
                        MenEngage Alliance, scaling up GBV prevention programs to reach 10,000 men and boys by the end
                        of 2025. We also plan to work more closely with UNFPA to establish permanent women’s health
                        centers in five major camps, providing ongoing maternal care and GBV support to 20,000 women
                        annually. These initiatives will complement our tent distribution efforts, ensuring holistic
                        support for displaced families.</p>
                    <p>Internationally, we hope to partner with additional organizations, such as the International
                        Rescue Committee (IRC), to improve water and sanitation in camps, addressing the root causes of
                        disease outbreaks that threaten unsheltered families. Locally, we aim to train 500 community
                        leaders in partnership with AGIR-DRC over the next two years, empowering them to lead aid
                        distribution and advocacy efforts in their own camps. These ambitious goals hinge on increased
                        funding and support, but with our partners by our side, we believe a stronger, safer Goma is
                        within reach. Together, we can shield more families, rebuild more lives, and create a future
                        where displacement does not mean despair. <a href="/volunteer.html" class="read-more">Join us in
