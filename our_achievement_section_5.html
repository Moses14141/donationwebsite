                        class="section-image left">
                    <p>In Goma, North Kivu, where conflict and displacement have left over 1 million people in camps as
                        of March 2025, rigid gender norms and ongoing insecurity create a challenging environment for
                        women and girls. Wokovuway, a grassroots NGO, is addressing these intertwined issues by
                        promoting positive masculinity among men and boys to foster gender equality, while also creating
                        safe spaces that provide security and access to essential commodities. These efforts aim to
                        restore trust, dignity, and opportunity for displaced communities amidst a volatile backdrop.
                    </p>
                    <p>The recent capture of Goma by M23 rebels and Rwandan forces in February 2025 has heightened
                        insecurity, with over 71,000 people displaced in Lushagala camp alone. Wokovuway’s initiatives,
                        supported by partners like MenEngage Alliance and UNFPA, tackle both cultural barriers and
                        immediate safety needs, offering a holistic approach to empowerment in a region where 25.4
                        million people are in need. By addressing gender dynamics and providing secure environments, we
                        contribute to a more equitable and stable future for Goma. <a href="about.html"

                    <h3>MASCULINITY AND POSITIVITY: EMPOWERING WOMEN</h3>
                    <img src="../images/masculinity_positivity.jpg" alt="Men and Boys in Community Dialogue in Goma"
                        class="section-image right">
                    <p>In a society where rigid gender norms often marginalize women, Wokovuway takes a transformative
                        approach by engaging men and boys in promoting gender equality in Goma. In collaboration with
                        MenEngage Alliance, we encourage positive masculinity traits such as confidence and leadership
                        to break harmful gender stereotypes. In 2024, Wokovuway trained 500 men and boys in displacement
                        camps like Lushagala, raising awareness on GBV prevention and menstrual hygiene management
                        (MHM), fostering a deeper understanding of the challenges women face.</p>
                    <p>These initiatives go beyond awareness; they encourage men to become active allies in women’s
                        empowerment. During a recent community dialogue in Lushagala in 2025, men were encouraged to
                        support women in decision-making roles, building their confidence to challenge traditional
                        expectations. By promoting qualities like empathy and accountability, Wokovuway helps men
                        redefine masculinity in a way that supports equality, creating an environment where women and
                        girls can thrive. This approach helps reduce violence and fosters healthier, more respectful
                        relationships within Goma’s communities. <a href="donate.html" class="read-more">Support our
                            work for gender equality.</a></p>

                    <h3>COMMUNITY DIALOGUES FOR CHANGE</h3>
                    <img src="../images/community_dialogue.jpg" alt="Community Dialogue in Goma"
                        class="section-image left">
                    <p>Wokovuway’s community dialogues are a cornerstone of our efforts to promote positive masculinity
                        and gender equality in Goma. These dialogues bring together men, women, and community leaders to
                        discuss gender norms, challenge stereotypes, and build mutual understanding. In 2025, we
                        organized a series of dialogues in Lushagala and Bulengo camps, reaching over 1,200
                        participants. Men were encouraged to take on caregiving roles and support women’s leadership,
                        breaking the cultural expectation that men should dominate decision-making.</p>
                    <p>These discussions also address the intersection of masculinity and GBV, encouraging men to reject
                        violence and embrace nonviolent conflict resolution. Participants have reported a shift in
                        attitudes, with many men expressing a newfound respect for women’s contributions to the
                        community. By creating safe spaces for open conversation, Wokovuway fosters a culture of
                        accountability and respect, laying the groundwork for more equitable relationships in Goma’s
                        displacement camps and beyond. <a href="success.html" class="read-more">Read stories of

                    <h3>SAFE SPACES & SECURITY: FOSTERING TRUST AND DIGNITY</h3>
                    <img src="../images/safe_spaces.jpg" alt="Safe Space in Goma Camp" class="section-image right">
                    <p>In the midst of Goma’s escalating insecurity, Wokovuway is committed to creating safe spaces
                        where displaced families can access essential commodities and rebuild their sense of dignity. In
                        2024, we distributed 2,000 weather-resistant tents in Bulengo camp, providing secure shelter for
                        15,000 people during the rainy season floods. These tents protect families from the elements,
                        reducing the risk of waterborne diseases and offering a safe haven amidst ongoing hostilities,
                        which have displaced over 200,000 people to Goma since early 2024.</p>
                    <p>We also partner with organizations like UNFPA and UNICEF to ensure access to vital supplies. In
                        2025, we provided dignity kits—including soap, clothing, and sanitary items—to 5,000 women in
                        Kanyaruchinya camp, fostering hygiene and self-respect. Our community dialogues double as safe
                        spaces where women and girls can share their experiences without fear, building trust within the
                        community. Despite the immense challenges, with main routes out of Goma often blocked and
                        essential utilities like water and electricity disrupted, Wokovuway’s efforts offer displaced
                        families a foundation for opportunity and hope. <a href="volunteer.html" class="read-more">Join

                <!-- Section 5: Shifting Cultural Norms -->
                <div class="article-section">
                    <h3>SHIFTING CULTURAL NORMS FOR EQUALITY</h3>
                    <img src="../images/cultural_shift.jpg" alt="Cultural Shift in Goma" class="section-image left">
                    <p>In Goma, cultural norms often dictate that men hold power over women, perpetuating inequality and
                        GBV. Wokovuway’s work with men and boys is gradually shifting these norms by promoting a vision
                        of masculinity rooted in respect and partnership. Through our partnership with MenEngage
                        Alliance, we’ve engaged 700 men in 2024 across Goma’s camps in workshops that challenge
                        patriarchal attitudes, encouraging them to see women as equals in both the home and community.
                    </p>
                    <p>These efforts align with global movements to transform masculinities, as seen in MenEngage
                        Africa’s campaigns during the 16 Days of Activism, where men marched alongside women to advocate
                        for GBV prevention. In Goma, our programs have led to measurable change: a 14% reduction in
                        attitudes accepting violence among participants, mirroring results from the World Bank’s DRC GBV
                        project. By redefining what it means to be a man in Goma, Wokovuway is creating a cultural shift
                        that supports women’s rights and fosters a more equitable society. <a

                        class="section-image right">
                    <p>Wokovuway is dedicated to expanding our efforts in promoting positive masculinity and creating
                        safe spaces in Goma. By 2026, we aim to train 10,000 men and boys across five major displacement
                        camps, focusing on GBV prevention and women’s leadership support, while also expanding our
                        community dialogues to reach 5,000 more participants. Additionally, we plan to provide shelter
                        and essential commodities to 20,000 more displaced individuals, ensuring secure environments
                        amidst ongoing insecurity.</p>
                    <p>Our vision is a Goma where equality and safety go hand in hand, allowing displaced communities to
                        rebuild with dignity. By continuing to partner with organizations like MenEngage Alliance,
                        UNFPA, and UNICEF, and by integrating these efforts with our existing programs—like MHM
                        education and women’s tailoring—Wokovuway is paving the way for a future where all residents can
                        thrive, free from the constraints of harmful norms and insecurity. In a city under constant
